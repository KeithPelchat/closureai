    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><small>Last updated: November 2025</small></p>
    <p><strong>ClosureAI is a product of More Leads Online LLC.</strong></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how More Leads Online LLC (“we,” “us,” “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the ClosureAI
      Holiday Sanity Pass and related services (the “Service”).
      By using the Service, you agree to the practices described here.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>a. Information You Provide</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Email address (for access, communication, and purchase records);</li>
      <li>Text and responses you submit during reflection sessions;</li>
      <li>Messages you send to our support team.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>b. Information Collected Automatically</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic technical data such as IP address, browser type, and device type;</li>
      <li>Usage data such as pages visited, session duration, and timestamps;</li>
      <li>Cookies or similar technologies used for login, session stability, and basic analytics.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not intentionally collect government ID numbers, full payment card details,
      or protected medical records through the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and maintain access to the Holiday Sanity Pass;</li>
      <li>Generate AI-based prompts, reflections, and responses;</li>
      <li>Improve the Service and understand how it is used;</li>
      <li>Communicate important updates, receipts, and support responses;</li>
      <li>Maintain security, prevent misuse, and comply with legal obligations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal information to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payment Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed by third-party providers such as Stripe. More Leads Online LLC
      does not store your full credit card number. Your payment information is handled
      according to the payment processor’s own privacy and security practices.
    </p>

    <h2>4. AI &amp; Content Handling</h2>
    <p>
      ClosureAI uses AI models to generate reflections based on the text you provide.
      Your inputs may be processed by these models in real-time to generate responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may review anonymized or aggregated usage data to improve the Service, troubleshoot,
      and refine prompts. We do not publicly share your individual session content.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Cookies</h2>
    <p>
      We use cookies and similar technologies for limited purposes, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Keeping you logged in and maintaining session state;</li>
      <li>Basic, privacy-respecting analytics to understand usage patterns;</li>
      <li>Security and fraud prevention.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can manage cookies through your browser settings, but disabling essential
      cookies may affect how the Service functions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep your email and account-related records as long as needed to provide
      the Service and maintain reasonable business records.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reflection entries may be stored during the Holiday Sanity Pass period to
      allow you to revisit prior sessions. After the pass period ends, data may
      be deleted, archived, or anonymized in the regular course of business.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We may share your information with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Service providers that help us operate the Service (hosting, email delivery,
        analytics, payment processing);
      </li>
      <li>
        Legal authorities, if required to comply with law, regulation, or valid legal process,
        or to protect our rights, property, or safety.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal data to advertisers or data brokers.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information,
      including secure hosting and restricted access to production systems.
      No online service can guarantee 100% security, but we work to protect your data
      from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your Choices</h2>
    <p>You may:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Update or correct your email address by contacting support;</li>
      <li>Request deletion of your account or reflection data where feasible;</li>
      <li>Opt out of non-essential emails (while still receiving important transactional messages).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is intended for adults 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect
      personal information from children. If we learn that a minor has used the Service,
      we will take reasonable steps to delete related data.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The “Last updated” date
      at the top will indicate the latest revision. Continued use of the Service
      after an update means you accept the revised policy.
